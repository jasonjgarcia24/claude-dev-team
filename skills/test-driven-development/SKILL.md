# Test-Driven Development

Write a failing test before writing the code that makes it pass. For bug fixes, reproduce the bug with a test before attempting a fix. Tests are proof — "seems right" is not done. A codebase with good tests is an AI agent's superpower; a codebase without tests is a liability.

Invoked primarily by the `pepper` agent (`~/.claude/agents/test-engineer.md`). Follow directly when no persona is needed.

## The TDD Cycle

```
    RED                GREEN              REFACTOR
 Write a test    Write minimal code    Clean up the
 that fails  ──→  to make it pass  ──→  implementation  ──→  (repeat)
      │                  │                    │
      ▼                  ▼                    ▼
   Test FAILS        Test PASSES         Tests still PASS
```

### Step 1: RED — Write a Failing Test

Write the test first. It must fail. A test that passes immediately proves nothing.

```typescript
// RED — createTask does not exist yet, so this fails
describe('TaskService', () => {
  it('creates a task with title and default status', async () => {
    const task = await taskService.createTask({ title: 'Buy groceries' });

    expect(task.id).toBeDefined();
    expect(task.title).toBe('Buy groceries');
    expect(task.status).toBe('pending');
    expect(task.createdAt).toBeInstanceOf(Date);
  });
});
```

### Step 2: GREEN — Make It Pass

Write the minimum code to make the test pass. Do not over-engineer.

```typescript
// GREEN — minimal implementation
export async function createTask(input: { title: string }): Promise<Task> {
  const task = {
    id: generateId(),
    title: input.title,
    status: 'pending' as const,
    createdAt: new Date(),
  };
  await db.tasks.insert(task);
  return task;
}
```

### Step 3: REFACTOR — Clean Up

With tests green, improve the code without changing behavior:

- Extract shared logic
- Improve naming
- Remove duplication
- Optimize if necessary

Run tests after every refactor step to confirm nothing broke.

## The Prove-It Pattern (Bug Fixes)

When a bug is reported, do not start by trying to fix it. Start by writing a test that reproduces it.

```
Bug report arrives
       │
       ▼
  Write a test that demonstrates the bug
       │
       ▼
  Test FAILS (confirming the bug exists)
       │
       ▼
  Implement the fix
       │
       ▼
  Test PASSES (proving the fix works)
       │
       ▼
  Run full test suite (no regressions)
```

Example:

```typescript
// Bug: "Completing a task doesn't update the completedAt timestamp"

// Step 1: Write the reproduction test — it should FAIL
it('sets completedAt when task is completed', async () => {
  const task = await taskService.createTask({ title: 'Test' });
  const completed = await taskService.completeTask(task.id);

  expect(completed.status).toBe('completed');
  expect(completed.completedAt).toBeInstanceOf(Date);  // fails → bug confirmed
});

// Step 2: Fix the bug
export async function completeTask(id: string): Promise<Task> {
  return db.tasks.update(id, {
    status: 'completed',
    completedAt: new Date(),  // was missing
  });
}

// Step 3: Test passes → bug fixed, regression guarded
```

## The Test Pyramid

Invest testing effort according to the pyramid — most tests should be small and fast, with progressively fewer tests at higher levels:

```
          ╱╲
         ╱  ╲         E2E Tests (~5%)
        ╱    ╲        Full user flows, real browser
       ╱──────╲
      ╱        ╲      Integration Tests (~15%)
     ╱          ╲     Component interactions, API boundaries
    ╱────────────╲
   ╱              ╲   Unit Tests (~80%)
  ╱                ╲  Pure logic, isolated, milliseconds each
 ╱──────────────────╲
```

**The Beyonce Rule:** If you liked it, you should have put a test on it. Infrastructure changes, refactoring, and migrations are not responsible for catching your bugs — your tests are. If a change breaks your code and there was no test for it, that is on the author.

### Test Sizes (Resource Model)

Classify tests by what resources they consume:

| Size | Constraints | Speed | Example |
|------|------------|-------|---------|
| **Small** | Single process, no I/O, no network, no database | Milliseconds | Pure function tests, data transforms |
| **Medium** | Multi-process OK, localhost only, no external services | Seconds | API tests with test DB, component tests |
| **Large** | Multi-machine OK, external services allowed | Minutes | E2E tests, performance benchmarks, staging integration |

Small tests should make up the vast majority of the suite. They are fast, reliable, and easy to debug when they fail.

### Decision Guide

```
Is it pure logic with no side effects?
  → Unit test (small)

Does it cross a boundary (API, database, file system)?
  → Integration test (medium)

Is it a critical user flow that must work end-to-end?
  → E2E test (large) — limit these to critical paths
```

## Writing Good Tests

### Test State, Not Interactions

Assert on the *outcome* of an operation, not on which methods were called internally. Tests that verify method-call sequences break when the implementation is refactored, even if behavior is unchanged.

```typescript
// Good — tests what the function does (state-based)
it('returns tasks sorted by creation date, newest first', async () => {
  const tasks = await listTasks({ sortBy: 'createdAt', sortOrder: 'desc' });
  expect(tasks[0].createdAt.getTime())
    .toBeGreaterThan(tasks[1].createdAt.getTime());
});

// Bad — tests how the function works internally (interaction-based)
it('calls db.query with ORDER BY created_at DESC', async () => {
  await listTasks({ sortBy: 'createdAt', sortOrder: 'desc' });
  expect(db.query).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
    expect.stringContaining('ORDER BY created_at DESC')
  );
});
```

### DAMP Over DRY in Tests

In production code, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) is usually right. In tests, **DAMP (Descriptive And Meaningful Phrases)** is better. Each test should read like a specification and tell a complete story without requiring the reader to trace through shared helpers.

```typescript
// DAMP — each test is self-contained and readable
it('rejects tasks with empty titles', () => {
  const input = { title: '', assignee: 'user-1' };
  expect(() => createTask(input)).toThrow('Title is required');
});

it('trims whitespace from titles', () => {
  const input = { title: '  Buy groceries  ', assignee: 'user-1' };
  const task = createTask(input);
  expect(task.title).toBe('Buy groceries');
});
```

Duplication in tests is acceptable when it makes each test independently understandable.

### Prefer Real Implementations Over Mocks

Use the simplest test double that gets the job done. The more real code the tests exercise, the more confidence they provide.

```
Preference order (most to least preferred):
1. Real implementation  → Highest confidence, catches real bugs
2. Fake                 → In-memory version of a dependency (e.g., fake DB)
3. Stub                 → Returns canned data, no behavior
4. Mock (interaction)   → Verifies method calls — use sparingly
```

Use mocks only when the real implementation is too slow, non-deterministic, or has side effects you can't control (external APIs, email sending). Over-mocking creates tests that pass while production breaks.

### Use the Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern

```typescript
it('marks overdue tasks when deadline has passed', () => {
  // Arrange — set up the test scenario
  const task = createTask({
    title: 'Test',
    deadline: new Date('2025-01-01'),
  });

  // Act — perform the action being tested
  const result = checkOverdue(task, new Date('2025-01-02'));

  // Assert — verify the outcome
  expect(result.isOverdue).toBe(true);
});
```

### One Assertion Per Concept

```typescript
// Good — each test verifies one behavior
it('rejects empty titles', () => { ... });
it('trims whitespace from titles', () => { ... });
it('enforces maximum title length', () => { ... });

// Bad — everything in one test
it('validates titles correctly', () => {
  expect(() => createTask({ title: '' })).toThrow();
  expect(createTask({ title: '  hello  ' }).title).toBe('hello');
  expect(() => createTask({ title: 'a'.repeat(256) })).toThrow();
});
```

### Name Tests Descriptively

```typescript
// Good — reads like a specification
describe('TaskService.completeTask', () => {
  it('sets status to completed and records timestamp', ...);
  it('throws NotFoundError for non-existent task', ...);
  it('is idempotent — completing an already-completed task is a no-op', ...);
  it('sends notification to task assignee', ...);
});

// Bad — vague names
describe('TaskService', () => {
  it('works', ...);
  it('handles errors', ...);
  it('test 3', ...);
});
```

## Anti-Patterns, Rationalizations, and Red Flags

For anti-patterns to avoid, common rationalizations, and red flags, see `references/anti-patterns.md`.

## Browser Runtime Verification

For browser-based changes, combine TDD with runtime verification — see the `browser-testing-with-devtools` skill.

## Subagent Delegation

For when and how to spawn a subagent to write reproduction tests, see `references/subagent-delegation.md`.

## Verification

After completing any implementation:

- [ ] Every new behavior has a corresponding test
- [ ] All tests pass: `npm test`
- [ ] Bug fixes include a reproduction test that failed before the fix
- [ ] Test names describe the behavior being verified
- [ ] No tests were skipped or disabled
- [ ] Coverage hasn't decreased (if tracked)
